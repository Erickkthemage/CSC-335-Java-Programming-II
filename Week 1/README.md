# Exercise 1

Define the class PracticeClass. It should have a string attribute ‘date’ to represent the date. This class should not have a constructor.

# Exercise 2

Define the class Cat. The class should have a constructor but without any parameters. The constructor will generate the following attributes.
- breed - "american shorthair"
- color - "black"
- name - "kiwi"

# Exercise 3

Define the class Superhero. The class should have a constructor that accepts the following arguments (in this order):
- name- String with the name of the super hero, e.g. "Spider-Man"
- secretIdentity - String with the true name of the hero, e.g. "Peter Parker"
- powers - An array of strings with each element representing a power, e.g.
- {"superhuman strength", "superhuman speed", "superhuman reflexes", "superhuman durability", "healing factor", "spider-sense alert", "heightened senses", "wallcrawling"}

# Exercise 4

Define the class Observation which will help record observational data from a scientific outpost in Antarctica. The class should have a constructor that accepts parameters for date, temperature, elevation, and penguins. There should also be an attribute for precipitation. Since Antarctica is a desert, precipitation should default to 0.
- date- String with the date of the observation, e.g. "October 26, 2019"
- temperature - Double with the temperature in Celsius, e.g. -47
- elevation - Double with elevation in meters, e.g. 329.4
- penguins - Integer representing the number of penguins observed, e.g. 3
- precipitation- Double with precipitation in centimeters, defaults to 0

# Exercise 5

Define the class BigCat which will help record information on the animals in the Panthera genus (tiger, lion, jaguar, leopard, and snow leopard). Since all animals are in the same genus, the object should have the class attribute genus with the value panthera. The constructor should accept the following parameters (in this order):
- species- String with the species of the animal, e.g. "tigris"
- commonName - String with the common name of the animal, e.g. "tiger"
- habitat - Array of strings with location of the animal, e.g. {"asia"}
